# Spicy Shrimp Chowder

## Overview

Full disclosure, I wing this recipe every time and generally tune it to the audience. For example, getting repeatable spice levels with serrano can be tricky so best of luck there, and the volumes needed when making the white roux often need adjusting based on the size of the potato used. 

## Ingredients

- 1-4 Serrano peppers (seeded)

- 4-6 Tablespoons butter depending on how much bread you add for dumplings

- 1 Russet potato, cubed

- 3 cloves minced garlic

- 1/4-1/3 cup enriched white flour

- 1/2 to whole loaf favorite fresh bread

- ~ 1/2 quart Milk

- 1/3 cup heavy cream

- 1/2 lb peeled + deveined shrimp

- Salt and pepper to taste

Optional:

- White wine/distilled vinegar

- 1/4 cup chicken stock

## Process

1. Cook the shrimp if not precooked. Method doesn't really matter. Set aside

2. (Optional) Blanch the potato cubes in boiling water with a dash of vinegar. This makes the potatos hold their shape/texture in later steps. Drain.

3. In a large cast iron dutch oven, pan fry the peppers and potatos on medium-medium high until golden and beginning to be fragrant, about 10 min. Add the garlic and black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 3 min. 

4. Make a white roux: Easy hack here is to add flour directly to the buttered chunklets in the pot and stir until coated rather than separating; this usually leads to a creamier roux. Once the flour turns a light golden brown, add the heavy cream and let thicken for a minute or so, then slowly add the milk making sure not to bring down the temperature too much. Note, there will be excess butter forming at the top of the pot, this is actually what you want.

5. Bring the pot to a light simmer and add torn chunks of the bread loaf, this should soak up the extra butter, and salt to taste. Let simmer for 20-30 min until thick and spicy. 

6. Add the shrimp and (optional) chicken stock to thin out the soup. Then simmer for additional 5 min, taking care not to overcook shrimp
