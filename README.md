# Introduction
A list of random recipes I've either made up, am developing, or have shamelessly stolen with some modifications (will always cite).

## Getting started
All the recipes are documented using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) flavored markdown. I highly recommend cloning the repo and loading it as an Obsidian Vault.
