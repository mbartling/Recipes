# Introduction
A list of random recipes I've either made up, am developing, or have shamelessly stolen with some modifications (will always cite).

## Getting started
All the recipes are documented using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) flavored markdown. I highly recommend cloning the repo and loading it as an Obsidian Vault.

![[Table of Contents]]

You can still view the recipes without Obsidian, but it does automatically render out things like tables of contents + useful graphics for deciding on meals.
